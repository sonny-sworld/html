<p>Scientists are currently monitoring astroid worth</p> quadrillions of dollars.

<p><div id="hi">The rare metallic asteroid is known as Astroid 16 Psyche. It is located between Mars and Jupiter and is one of the most massive objects in the asteroid belt in our solar system. Psyche measures about 220km across.</div></p>

<p><div id="NASA">Scientists from Planetary Science Journal have been looking a closer look at this mysterious asteroid, using data from the Hubble Telescope.</div></p>

<p><div id="Jupiter">Scientists think the asteroid is mostly made of iron and nickel. If that is the case then it would be valued at around $10,000 quadrillion. That is more money than currently exists in the world.</div></p>

<p><div id="k">In 2022, NASA plan to send an unmanned spacecraft to Psyche to study it up close and better determine its composition.</div></p>
