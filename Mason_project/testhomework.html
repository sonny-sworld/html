Pablo Robledo, 34, who was being held on a first-degree murder charge, was found and arrested today in southwest Oklahoma City by city police and US marshals, said jail spokesman Mac Mullings. <br><br>

Mullings noted that Robledo was arrested without incident shortly before 2.30pm (local time) in a neighborhood where he may have had family living and authorities had been looking out for him.<br><br>

Robledo and his cellmate escaped by breaking a window of their cell and climbing down, Mullings said, adding that Robledo was seen on jail security video about 5.25am outside the jail.<br><br>

His cellmate, Jose Hernandez, fell or jumped from the makeshift rope around the fourth floor, apparently breaking a leg, before being found and subsequently arrested by Oklahoma City police Friday morning.<br><br>

Hernandez is hospitalized in undisclosed condition for his injury, according to Mullings.<br><br>

Jail records show Robledo had been jailed since June 2019 on murder, assault and battery, domestic abuse and other charges.<br><br>

Court records also note he had pleaded not guilty and was slated for trial beginning August 31. </p>
