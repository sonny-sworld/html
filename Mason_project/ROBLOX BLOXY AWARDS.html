Saturday, March 21st was a star-studded celebration unlike any other: the 7th Annual Bloxy Awards. There were thrills, surprises, and a stage full of worthy winners. Most of all, community members from all over the world came together as one and experienced the entire award ceremony within Roblox for the first time ever, thanks to our new in-engine video streaming technology.<br><br>

Way before the proverbial curtain went up, the Bloxys virtual space was swinging with fun and festivities as far as the eye could see. Over half a million concurrent players, developers, creators, and community leaders made their way to the neon halls of the event on Saturday, racing scooters, chilling on floaties, completing quests, and picking up fabulous in-game souvenirs. Quests were crushed, collectibles collected, and our $100,000 goal for donations to Make-A-Wish and Code.org through the sale of limited-edition, user-created items was reached in record time. Thanks to everyone who attended, and thank you so much for supporting the dreams and aspirations of kids and teens worldwide!<br><br>


Once the show started, the hype reached critical levels. Spectators witnessed not only fourteen fully-animated skits featuring Roblox Video Star Leah Ashe and our very own emcee, JParty, but also the world premieres of music videos from luminaries LOGinHDi, Cybernova, and Kawaii Kunicorn. There was also a surprise: the official teaser trailer for an all-new Egg Hunt event, Agents of E.G.G.! And, of course, there were the awards themselves. Here’s a full list of this year’s champions:<br><br>
