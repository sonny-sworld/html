The website crashed on Wednesday night and early Thursday morning after the jackpot was announced.<br><br>

High traffic is expected again from around 5pm tonight, potentially overloading the MyLotto site again, Lotto warns.<br><br>

"Saturdays are typically our biggest day for ticket sales, as Kiwis often wait until the day of the draw to buy their tickets," Lotto's Marie Winfield says.<br><br>

"I can't stress enough how important it is to buy your ticket early if you want to be in to win."<br>

Sales for this week's draw are likely to be complicated by the Alert Level 3 lockdown in Auckland, and Ms Winfield says around half of the 1.6 million tickets sold so far were sold online.<br><br>

She's expecting more than 2 million tickets to be sold before the draw.<br><br>

The must-win draw means if no one gets all the Lotto numbers and the Powerball, the prize will be split amongst the winners of the next-highest division.<br><br>

The largest single win in Lotto's history was in November 26, when someone won more than $44 million.<br><br>

Earlier this year, another $50 million must-win draw was split between two winners in Auckland, winning more than $25 million each.<br><br>

The draw will be aired on TVNZ1 at 8pm.<br><br>
