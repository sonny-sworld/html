The store has named itself Huruhuru, thinking it was a translation of hair or wool, but it can also translate to pubic hair.<br><br>
TV personality Te Hamua Nikora made that known in a Facebook video.<br><br>
An AUT lecturer, Hēmi Kelly, told Midday Report some companies were incorporating te reo Māori properly, while others failed to get guidance.<br><br>
After a quick search, he found language experts that could help.<br><br>
"I just did a little Google search actually - I was like Māori language consultants - and there they are, they just pop up."<br><br>
"I don't see why we should be having these issues," he said.<br><br>
A spokesperson from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington">Wellington</a> leather store said it cannot afford to simply change its name.<br><br>
Aynur Karakoc said she and her husband picked the name as it was the Māori word for wool, feather, or fur.<br><br>
She said they felt they had done everything right when naming their business, and meant no offence.<br><br>
"We got the Intellectual Property Office of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand">New Zealand</a> permission to use this name - we also got approval of the Māori committee... we wouldn't use this name or trademark if we hadn't been given the permission," she said.<br><br>
Karakoc said the business was already struggling with the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019"> Covid-19</a> downturn.<br><br>
She said they were now also receiving racial abuse and threats and the property office told them to go to the police.<br><br>
"There will be other people and then every time we will report them to the police? This is not the solution," she said.<br><br>
A Canadian brewery, Hell's Basement, has also come under fire on social media for naming their New Zealand Pale Ale, Huruhuru.<br><br>
RNZ has approached them for comment.
