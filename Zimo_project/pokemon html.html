<div style="color:grey"> Niantic sent over the schedule for Day 1 of Pokemon Go Fest 2020, and it’s going to be packed. The event will give players plenty of opportunities to catch sought-after shinies with the rotating habitats, but what’s more important is the traditional Ultra Unlock bonuses that’s tied to the event.
<br><br>
That means even if you aren’t participating, you will benefit from what happens at Pokemon Go Fest 2020. On the other hand, that also puts a lot of pressure on the attendees. Here is what’s going on for day for those meticulous planners.</div>
<br><br>
UPDATE: Niantic increased Pokemon storage. The max is 3,500 now. I still advise you to make more room for Go Fest via transferring or trades.
<br><br>

ULTRA UNLOCK BONUSES
<div style="color: grey">  Now that you know the habitats for each hour, let’s take a look at the Ultra Unlock bonuses. Throughout the day, trainers will have 32 global challenges that they can complete. They can keep track using the Global Challenge Arena in the Today View of “Pokemon Go.” Achieving the goal opens up themed weeks following the event. For clarification’s sake, Ultra Bonuses are open to all trainers. They are rewards that Go Fest players earn for everyone globally. You do not need to be a ticket-holder to participate in the events after Go Fest. They are the following:
<br><br>
Ultra unlock Week 1:<div style="color: grey">Dragon Week — Complete 8 challenges</div>
Ultra unlock Week 2:<div style="color: grey">Enigma Week — Complete 16 challenges</div>
Ultra unlock Week 3:<div style="color: grey">Unova Week — Complete 24 challenges</div>
<br><br>
Here’s what trainers get for Dragon Week, which runs 1 p.m. July 31 to 1 p.m. Aug. 7
<br><br>
The following Pokemon will appear more in the wild:

Bagon <div style="color: grey">(shiny available) — This is a must grab for PvP and some raid purposes.</div>
Trapinch <div style="color: grey">(shiny available) — This Pokemon has appeared in a Community Day. This is your second chance at getting a useful Pokemon in some Go Battle League leagues.</div>
Swablu <div style="color: grey">(shiny available) — This evolves into Altaria, which is a staple in the GBL. It may also be a factor because of a possible Mega Evolution.</div>
Gible <div style="color: grey">(shiny available) but will be more rare. — This Pokemon’s final form Garchomp is excellent in the Premier Cup.</div>

<br><Br>

As I mentioned before, this week will introduce shiny Deino. It is green like a <a href="https://i.redd.it/xrnsen3fmuz31.jpg">     money or the Incredible Hulk.</a> Its Dark/Dragon typing makes it unique and it could be good in future cups.</div>
<br><br>
Pokemon in the games.
The following Pokemon will appear more in the wild:
Staryu (shiny available) — This is a collectible and one of the original Kanto Pokemon.
Jigglypuff — This is a curious selection. I’m wondering if there is more tied to this Pokemon.
Clefairy (shiny available) — This Pokemon’s shiny version debuted a few weeks ago. If you weren’t able to get it then, you now have a second chance.
Lunatone (shiny available) — The same goes for this Pokemon.
Solrock (shiny available) — Ditto (not the Pokemon) for this one.
Baltoy (shiny available) — This Pokemon could be useful in future cups and the shiny version is OK
