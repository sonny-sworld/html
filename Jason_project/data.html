    Scott Pritchard, CEO of Precinct <a href="https://www.google.com">Properties</a> which owns the $1 billion development housing more than 120 shops in the central city, said pre-Covid-19 turnover forecasts were being exceeded.<br><br>
“Seven or eight weeks in, we’re really, really delighted with the sales turnover and really pleased with the pedestrian count … it’s better than we expected.”<br><br>
The mall opened on June 11 soon after the country moved to Alert Level 1. Mr Pritchard said there was always a bit of uncertainty when opening malls, even without a pandemic.<br><br> 
Mr Pritchard said tenants were “broadly” happy with their sales turnovers. 
“It’s a mix. Like any centre, you’re going to have some going really well and some that aren’t going quite so well,” Mr Pritchard said.
